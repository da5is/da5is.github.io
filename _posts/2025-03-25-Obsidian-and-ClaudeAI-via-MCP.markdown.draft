A Model Context Protocol (MCP) adapter was recently released that allows you to use Claude Desktop to interact with your Obsidian Notes.  To install it...

1. Install the Claude Desktop client - the simplest way is to run `winget install claude` from a Windows Terminal.  It will prompt you for elevation if you're running in a standard user session.  Following that, log into the desktop client.
2.  Install Node.js - again, via winget:  `winget install node.js`.
3.  Restart your Windows terminal.
4.  Install the MCP connector via NPX:  `npx @smithery/cli install mcp-obsidian --client claude` (via [https://github.com/smithery-ai/mcp-obsidian/tree/main])(https://github.com/smithery-ai/mcp-obsidian/tree/main).  It will prompt you for the location of your Obsidian Vault during the install.
